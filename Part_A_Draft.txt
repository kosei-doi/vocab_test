I watched Dr. Shinya Yamanaka's Nobel lecture. He talked about iPS cells. These cells are very special. They can become any type of cell in our body.

Dr. Yamanaka was a doctor before. He wanted to help sick people. He found a way to make iPS cells from normal cells. He used only four genes. This was a big discovery in 2006.

I think his research is very important. It can help many people. For example, it can help people with Parkinson's disease. It can also help find new medicines.

Dr. Yamanaka spoke clearly. He explained difficult science in simple words. He seems like a kind person who wants to help others.

His work gives hope to many people.
